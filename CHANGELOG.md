# Changelog

## Unreleased — shared V4.05 frontend and premium controls

- Import the frozen V4.05 frontend once into `frontend/`; derive integration and dashboard payloads with exact SHA-256 parity and a fail-closed approved-delta guard.
- Use the supplied transparent close/copy artwork while preserving all dialog and clipboard handlers, 44×44 hit targets, content and layout. Remove only the visible `DEV` label.
- Serve the integration-local payload using supported asynchronous HTTP static registration; resource registration remains manual.
- Add both-delivery browser coverage, frozen-reference comparison and native HTTP route tests. Local browser/build/package checks pass; native runtime tests are blocked on Windows (`fcntl`) and require Linux CI. No release or tag.


## 0.17.0 — release-candidate preparation

Initial native Home Assistant integration release line.

### Added

- UI Config Flow with a single Config Entry.
- Persistent settings backed by `ConfigEntry.options`.
- Typed per-entry runtime state.
- 16 native configuration entities: 4 Selects, 5 Numbers and 7 Switches.
- Validation for configuration values and ordered observation/storm/danger radii.
- Dynamic `person.*` and `zone.*` reference-location choices.
- One-time, native-wins, non-destructive migration from supported legacy `lightning_detection_*` helpers.
- Package/helper-free fresh-install path.
- Documented unload/re-enable, deletion and rollback semantics.
- Integration-local Home Assistant brand icons.
- GPL-3.0-only software/documentation licensing with separate reserved branding policy.
- HACS Integration, Hassfest, deterministic package and Home Assistant runtime validation workflows.

### Fixed during public real-install validation

- Reclassified the Config Entry from Home Assistant `helper` to `service`. The 2026 frontend Integrations dashboard intentionally filters helper Config Entries out, which made a correctly loaded Gewitterradar entry appear to have disappeared after installation/restart.
- Replaced the direct `async_write_ha_state()` call in the dynamic reference-location listener with Home Assistant's thread-safe `schedule_update_ha_state()` path. This addresses the real-install `RuntimeError` reported when a location add/remove callback was dispatched outside the event loop.
- Added regression coverage for the user-visible integration classification and the thread-safe dynamic-location callback.
- Recorded the first real HACS installation findings and separated current-integration defects from historical Entity Registry/HACS leftovers.

### Real-install evidence

- Public HACS repository installation completed successfully.
- Config Entry reached `loaded` state.
- All 16 native configuration entities were present.
- Configuration values persisted unchanged across a full Home Assistant restart.
- HACS repository state changed from `pending-restart` to `installed` after the full restart.
- Public HACS repository validation passes all 9 checks.

### Compatibility

- Designed to coexist with the frozen Gewitterradar V4.04 Dashboard/Card migration baseline.
- Dashboard/Card distribution remains separate at `TheDaimos/gewitterradar-dashboard`.
- The Blitzortung.org Home Assistant integration remains the live lightning-event data source used by the Dashboard.

### Known limitation

- Historical `device_tracker.*` reference selections are not automatically migrated.
- Historical unavailable Entity Registry entries and stale HACS update entities are intentionally not deleted automatically by the native integration.

### Release gates still open

- HACS update to the corrected real-install candidate;
- full-restart verification that Gewitterradar remains visible under Devices & services → Integrations;
- trigger/re-check dynamic `person.*` / `zone.*` changes with no thread-safety error;
- real HACS rollback and re-update proof;
- final Android/iPad frontend spot checks, including Android last-compass persistence.
